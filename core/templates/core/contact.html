<p>Hello and welcome!</p>

<p>I´m María, the brains behind Little Dream Gardens.
I´m passionate about all crafts, especially all miniature related, and I started miniature gardening in 2020 and it has been an amazing journey!
I wanted to share all that I´ve been learning during this past year, in combination with my new projects and diy´s.</p>
<p>Is funny because when I was little, my mum use to check my pockets when I came back home from the playground. There, she will find innumerable treasures such as twigs, pebbles, leafs or candy wraps… now, a few years later, I still come back home with my pockets full of new things for my miniature gardens.</p>
<p>Please bare in mind that all my tutorials are for adults, unless otherwise stated. The props I make are not toys and are not safe for children, so is better to keep them away from them.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact me with any questions and to send me your creations!
I hope you enjoy my website!</p>
